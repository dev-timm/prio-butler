Too many task at once and don’t know what to focus on first? Alfred, your own personal butler has come to help organizing your priorities.

prio butler’s process of prioritizing tasks is based on a popular matrix used by many companies and product teams around the world. By asking you just a couple of questions, Alfred will recommend which tasks you should prioritize more and which ones you might want to work on at a later point in time.

## Product Decisions

### User Needs
As a user I want to...

- have an overview of all of my tasks so that I don’t have to be worried to forget them
- have my tasks well-prioritized so that I know exactly which ones to focus on first
- have my list of priorities in digital form so that I can easily access them while I’m working
- be guided through the task prioritization process so that I don’t waste my time unnecessarily

### MVP

prio butler’s core functionalities focus on making sure that the most important user problems are addressed first. The user has the option to create a new task, show a list of all open tasks and their priorities, delete a task and quit the program.

### The Eisenhower Matrix

As mentioned in the introduction, the prioritization of the tasks is based on a popular matrix used by companies and product teams - The Eisenhower Matrix. Each of the tasks the user submits is evaluated based on two important criteria: importance and urgency. When the user requests to see all the tasks, they are returned as a prioritized list.
